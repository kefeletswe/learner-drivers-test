The test will have more questions
The test will have different categories of questions like road only questions, signs, safety in which the user can choose according to their own preferences
The test will have a voice over or sound feature

DATA MODEL

I have decided to use functions, variables ,loops and dictionaries for my project

The dictionary stores the questions and answers for the test.
the functions divides the test into question, answers, answer checker and scores.
The loops gives the user feedback or output depending on which answer and options  they picked.

TESTING
I have tested it manually by doing the following:
Passed the code through PEP8 and the only problems are indetation and recommedation to put whitespaces between the operators
There are 24 problems on my terminal

BUGS
When was running the test i got syntax error results and the app could not load in herosake beacuse i had used the import form love sandwiches and did not put the word from. when i put FROM on the second line the code was good and i decided to removve the whole import.
